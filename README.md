Charity website template with CMS, creted with PHP.

Hello.
To get started please edit the variables in "functions.php" file 
	$dbhost with your hostname, I think localhost will be ok for you, as for me.
  	$dbname  the databse you want to use. You should in advance create a db in phpMyAdmin. For me I have chosen to call i "project" 
  	$dbuser  is the username of the user, who will have the permissions on that db. In xampp server's default settings it is just "root"
  	$dbpass  is the password of the user, who will have the permissions on that db. In xampp server's default settings, there is no password

After that lunch the setup.php in your browser, which will initialize all the essential tables and users for testing.
	The first user is admin, who has username: "admin" and password: "password1234"

Thank you.
